<p>Recipient of the 2023 Walter Hinrichsen Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Taiwanese American composer <b>SHIH-HUI CHEN</b> is fascinated by the narratives at the intersection of identity, culture, and tradition. In her works, she seeks to cross boundaries between music and society, between the music of distinct cultures, and between music and other art forms. </p>

<p>This perspective informs her creative works and community projects. For example, her recent project, a cross-genre theatrical work, <i>Kimchi, Pickles and Wine</i>, explores the idea of food preservation to bring together people of all worldwide cultures. Her desire to create connections among members of the global community led her to found <i>21C: Classical, Contemporary, and Cross-Cultural Asian Music</i>, an annual performing arts festival fostering intercultural exchange between Asia and the U.S. through a series of lectures and performances.
</p>

<p>Seeking a more in-depth understanding of the music and cultures of her homeland, Chen spent two years studying indigenous and nanguan music in Taiwan, in affiliation with the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica; the works that grew from this study synthesize a variety of musical genres. They include <i>Withholding the Umbrella</i> for <i>Chinese Orchestra,</i> inspired by Taiwanese nanguan music and commissioned by the Taiwan Institute<i>;</i> <i>Returning Souls: Four Short pieces on Three Formosan Amis Legends</i>, music Chen composed for a documentary by anthropological filmmaker Taili Hu; and <i>Echoes from Within: A Musical Response to Cy Twombly</i>, a 45-minute site-specific work for sheng, double bass and electronics, commissioned by The Menil Collection in collaboration with composer Kurt Stallmann.

  “Among the composers of Asian descent living in the U.S.A., Shih-Hui Chen is most successful in balancing the very refined spectral traditions of the East with the polyphonic practice of Western art-music. In a seamless narrative, her beautiful music, always highly inventive and expressive, is immediately as appealing as it is demanding and memorable.” --  2007 Goddard Lieberson award from American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p>
